def RecordCurrentness(photo_folder: str, threshold_days: float) -> dict:
    """
    Evaluates record currentness for a folder of photo files and gathers summary information.
    
    For each photo in the folder (files ending with .jpg, .jpeg, .png), the function:
      - Computes the file age in days (using the file modification time).
      - Marks the file as current (record_currentness = 1) if its age is <= threshold_days;
        otherwise, it is considered out-of-date (record_currentness = 0).
    
    Returns a dictionary containing, for each file:
      - "age_days": The fileâ€™s age in days.
      - "record_currentness": 1 if the file is current, or 0 if not.
    
    The summary includes:
      - total_files: Total number of image files processed.
      - current_files: Number of files considered current.
      - overall_currentness: Ratio (current_files / total_files).
    
    Parameters:
      photo_folder: Path to the folder containing photo files.
      threshold_days: The age threshold in days; files with age <= threshold_days are considered current.
    
    Returns:
      A dictionary with detailed file results and a summary.
