## **Comprehensive Explanation of "Data Quality Model for Analytics and Machine Learning"**

This document presents a **structured framework of data quality characteristics** designed for **data analytics** and **machine learning (ML)** projects. This model is based on the international standard **ISO/IEC 25012**, dividing characteristics into four main categories. The underlined features are considered the data quality model for analytics and ML.

---

### **1. Independent Data Quality Characteristics**  
These characteristics are **inherent to the data** and do not depend on the system or infrastructure:  
- **Accuracy**: Conformance of data to reality or the original source (e.g., no errors in numerical or textual values).  
- **Completeness**: Absence of missing (Null/NaN) values in critical fields.  
- **Consistency**: Coordination of data over time and across different sources (e.g., no conflicting records).  
- **Credibility**: Reliability of data (e.g., verified by an authoritative source).  
- **Currentness**: The time gap between data generation and its use (e.g., outdated data may be irrelevant).  

**Example:**  
If product prices in sales data are entered incorrectly (**low accuracy**), the sales prediction model will produce inaccurate results.

---

### **2. Independent and System-Dependent Data Quality Characteristics**  
These characteristics depend on both the **data** and the **data management system**:  
- **Accessibility**: Easy access to data for authorized users (e.g., security restrictions).  
- **Compliance**: Adherence to regulations (e.g., GDPR for privacy).  
- **Confidentiality**: Restriction of access to sensitive data (e.g., encryption of personal data).  
- **Efficiency**: Optimal resource usage (e.g., storing data without wasting disk space).  
- **Precision**: Level of detail in the data (e.g., number of decimal places in numbers).  
- **Traceability**: Ability to track the history of data changes (e.g., change logs).  
- **Understandability**: Use of standard symbols, units, and language (e.g., dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format).  

**Example:**  
If user-related data is stored without encryption (**low confidentiality**), the risk of data leakage increases.

---

### **3. System-Dependent Data Quality Characteristics**  
These characteristics entirely depend on the **implementation of the data management system**:  
- **Availability**: Ensuring access to data when needed (e.g., 99.9% uptime).  
- **Portability**: Ability to move data between systems without quality loss (e.g., exporting to JSON/CSV).  
- **Recoverability**: Ability to restore data after system failure (e.g., backup usage).  

**Example:**  
If the data server becomes unavailable due to a power outage (**low availability**), analytical processes will be disrupted.

---

### **4. Additional Data Quality Characteristics**  
These characteristics are added to enhance usability for analytics and ML:  
- **Auditability**: Ability to verify data accuracy by independent entities.  
- **Identifiability**: Recognizing the identity of the data (e.g., anonymized data).  
- **Effectiveness**: Suitability of data for a specific goal (e.g., training a classification model).  
- **Balance**: Balanced distribution of data among classes (to avoid model bias).  
- **Diversity**: Presence of a wide range of examples in the data.  
- **Relevance**: Data being relevant to the problem under investigation.  
- **Representativeness**: Accurate reflection of the target population in the data.  
- **Similarity**: Homogeneity or heterogeneity of data (for clustering applications).  
- **Timeliness**: Data being up-to-date at the time of use.  

**Example:**  
If training data for a model is collected only from a specific geographical area (**low representativeness**), the model will perform poorly in other regions.

### **Detailed Explanations of Each Section**

---

#### **1. Syntactic Accuracy**  
Refers to the **conformance of data to predefined structural rules and formats**. It ensures data is correct in appearance (e.g., character count, data type, or specific patterns) based on defined standards.  

**Formula:**  
```
Syntactic Accuracy = (Number of Correctly Formatted Items) / (Total Items to Check)
```

**Example:**  
- A phone number format like `0912XXX1234` is invalid if incomplete (e.g., `0912` alone).  
- A postal code must meet length requirements (e.g., 10 digits).  

---

#### **2. Semantic Accuracy**  
Ensures **data conforms to real-world concepts and application-specific expectations**.  

**Formula:**  
```
Semantic Accuracy = (Number of Values Matching Real-World Concepts) / (Total Values to Check)
```

**Example:**  
- A negative review mislabeled as "positive" violates semantic accuracy.  
- Illogical values, like an age of 200 years, fail semantic validation.  

---

#### **3. Data Accuracy Assurance**  
Indicates **how much of the data has been validated** for syntactic and semantic accuracy.  

**Formula:**  
```
Data Accuracy Assurance = (Number of Validated Items) / (Total Items to Validate)
```

**Example:**  
If 800 out of 1,000 records have been validated, the data accuracy assurance is 80%.

---

#### **4. Risk of Dataset Inaccuracy**  
Represents the **proportion of outliers or unusual values** in the dataset.  

**Formula:**  
```
Risk of Dataset Inaccuracy = (Number of Outliers) / (Total Data Points)
```

**Example:**  
In a weather dataset, abnormal temperatures like 50Â°C in moderate climates indicate a possible error.

---

#### **5. Data Model Accuracy**  
Measures whether the **data structure aligns with system requirements**, such as the format of dates, relationships in tables, or schema standards.  

**Formula:**  
```
Data Model Accuracy = (Number of Elements Matching Requirements) / (Total Data Model Elements)
```

**Example:**  
A required `YYYY-MM-DD` date format entered as `DD/MM/YYYY` reduces model accuracy.

---

#### **6. Data Accuracy Range**  
Ensures **data values fall within a valid range**, based on defined constraints.  

**Formula:**  
```
Data Accuracy Range = (Number of Values Within Valid Range) / (Total Values to Check)
```

**Example:**  
User ages should be between `18` and `100`. Values outside this range require correction.

---

### **Final Summary**  

- **Syntactic** and **semantic accuracy** form the foundation of data quality.  
- **Data accuracy assurance** and **dataset inaccuracy risk** help measure data reliability.  
- **Data model accuracy** and **accuracy range** ensure compatibility with system requirements.  
- These metrics should be assessed and improved throughout the data lifecycle, from collection to analysis.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
To achieve optimal results in machine learning, all these metrics must be simultaneously evaluated and enhanced.
